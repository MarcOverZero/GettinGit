# GettinGit Tutorial

---

# Directions

-Fork and clone the GettinGit Repository to your **desktop**.  This will serve as a standalone reference file for this tutorial.
-You will create a new project file on your **desktop** for the walkthrough portion of this tutorial.  **Do not** nest the walkthrough tutorial in the GettinGit file structure.

Have fun and enjoy!  I hope this helps as you navigate learning git.  I will be adding new content and tutorials sporadically to this repository.  Make sure to tune in for future content.

Good luck!
